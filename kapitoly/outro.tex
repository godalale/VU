\textbf{NEED TO INCORPORATE REFs FROM ASSIGNMENT:}\\

[1] R. Abdul Khalek et al., Snowmass 2021 White Paper: Electron Ion Collider for High Energy Physics, arXiv:2203.13199\\
\textbf{!} \textit{exceptionally old (2021), but the required physics is probably still more or less relevant}\\

[2] EIC User Group,  White Paper on the Electron-Ion Collider in Preparation for the NSAC Long Range Plan, Zenodo (2023), \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7500024}\\
\textbf{!} \textit{what is the difference between this and [1]?}\\

[3] D. Boer et al., Physics case for quarkonium studies at the Electron Ion Collider, arXiv:2409.03691\\
\textbf{!} \textit{maybe useful for something about the $\phi$s? doesn't even have the good feynman diagram}\\

[4] Ch. Montag, Status of the Electron-Ion Collider, PoS SPIN2023 (2024) 135\\
\textbf{!} \textit{ten pages long, 25th International Spin Physics Symposium (SPIN 2023) 24-29 September 2023 (proceedings) - old and probably severely outdated $\rightarrow$ useful MAYBE only for the most basic facts (luminostity, used particle species...)}\\

[5] P. Antonioli, The European Participation to the Electron Ion Collider, Nucl.Phys.News 34 (2024) 3, 21-25\\
\textbf{!} \textit{not sure what can be used from this, published Sep 2024 - not sure how much to trust this person about the Participation; things could have already changed}
