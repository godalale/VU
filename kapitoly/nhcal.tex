\chapter{nHCal}\label{cha:nHCal} % chktex 24
extensively from pre-TDR - new iteration in two weeks - is it worth the wait?

WHERE IS THE GOOGLE DOC? 

Overview from some Leszek's presentation? is Leszek relevant?

\section{Motivation}
still tail catcher of nECal (what is that really, only of that?)

start with HERA (maybe) - then continue from that ("to not make the same mistake")

Vector meson - the matrix image + the 012K plots

only for e + Au and phi, or also e + p, and J/psi?

\section{Construction}
realistic dimensions and location

tiling? is it really important?

does clustering make sense to mention? - probably somewhere else (simulations)

changes?

sampling, N layers, ... ok, but what about material e.g.?

sampling fraction - possible to be compensating (Elke says NO)? what did Subhadip prove, then? - how achieved? how calculated?

but what about true construction? does Leszek now? does anybody?

two images from BP? or something else? cite myself?

anything about neutrons? meaningful?

is tilt usable? if for VU, also for DP?

\section{?}
